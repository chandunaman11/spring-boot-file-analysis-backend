# Multi-Tenancy Data Isolation Test Results

## Test Execution Summary
**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETE - Backend Not Running  
**Environment:** Development (localhost)

---

## üî¥ Critical Issue: Backend Not Available

The Spring Boot backend is **not running** on `http://localhost:8080`. All API calls are falling back to Next.js mock responses, which means **multi-tenancy cannot be fully tested**.

**Evidence:**
```bash
# Direct backend check
curl http://localhost:8080/api/organizations
# Result: Connection refused (Status 000)
```

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Successfully Tested

### 1. Frontend Proxy Layer (Next.js)
**Status:** PASS ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ User registration endpoint working
- ‚úÖ User login endpoint working  
- ‚úÖ JWT mock tokens generated
- ‚úÖ Proxy routes forward `X-Organization-Id` header correctly

**Test Results:**
```bash
# Register User A
POST /api/auth/register
Response: 201 Created
{
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": 1760609636975,
    "name": "Alice Admin",
    "email": "alice@orga.com",
    "role": "USER"
  }
}

# Register User B
POST /api/auth/register  
Response: 201 Created
{
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": 1760609637134,
    "name": "Bob Manager",
    "email": "bob@orgb.com",
    "role": "USER"
  }
}

# Login User A
POST /api/auth/login
Response: 200 OK
{
  "token": "mock-jwt-token-1760609637763",
  "refreshToken": "mock-refresh-token-1760609637763",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "alice@orga.com",
    "name": "Mock User",
    "role": "USER"
  }
}

# Login User B
POST /api/auth/login
Response: 200 OK
{
  "token": "mock-jwt-token-1760609637918",
  "refreshToken": "mock-refresh-token-1760609637918",
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "email": "bob@orgb.com",
    "name": "Mock User",
    "role": "USER"
  }
}
```

### 2. Updated Proxy Routes
**Status:** PASS ‚úÖ

The following routes now correctly forward the `X-Organization-Id` header:
- ‚úÖ `/api/projects` - GET and POST methods
- ‚úÖ Header forwarding logic implemented
- ‚úÖ Authorization token forwarding working

---

## üî¥ What Could NOT Be Tested (Backend Required)

### 1. OrganizationContextFilter ‚ùå
**Reason:** Backend not running

**Cannot verify:**
- X-Organization-Id header enforcement
- 403 Forbidden responses for missing header
- Organization membership validation
- Filter registration in SecurityConfig

### 2. Data Isolation Between Organizations ‚ùå
**Reason:** Backend not running

**Cannot verify:**
- User A can only see Org A's data
- User B can only see Org B's data
- Cross-organization access blocked
- Database-level isolation

### 3. Organization Management APIs ‚ùå
**Reason:** Backend not running

**Cannot test:**
- POST /api/organizations (create)
- GET /api/organizations (list)
- POST /api/organizations/{id}/members (add member)
- DELETE /api/organizations/{id}/members/{userId} (remove)

### 4. Better-Auth Schema Integration ‚ùå
**Reason:** Backend not running

**Cannot verify:**
- String UUID user IDs working
- Session table functioning
- Account table for social auth
- Verification table for email verification

---

## üìã To Complete Testing: Next Steps

### Step 1: Start Spring Boot Backend
```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
# OR if using Gradle:
./gradlew bootRun
```

The backend should start on `http://localhost:8080` with:
- H2 database initialized
- All entities created (User, Organization, OrganizationMember, Project, Task, etc.)
- OrganizationContextFilter registered
- JWT authentication enabled

### Step 2: Verify Backend is Running
```bash
# Check health
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

# Check Swagger docs
curl http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

# Check organizations endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/api/organizations
```

### Step 3: Execute Full Test Suite

#### Test 3.1: Create Organizations
```bash
# Get Alice's token
ALICE_TOKEN="<from login response>"

# Create Organization A (Alice as owner)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/organizations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Acme Construction",
    "description": "Organization A for testing"
  }'

# Expected: 201 Created with organization ID
# Save as ORG_A_ID

# Get Bob's token
BOB_TOKEN="<from login response>"

# Create Organization B (Bob as owner)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/organizations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOB_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "BuildCorp Ltd",
    "description": "Organization B for testing"
  }'

# Expected: 201 Created with organization ID
# Save as ORG_B_ID
```

#### Test 3.2: Create Projects with Organization Context
```bash
# Alice creates project in Org A
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Organization-Id: $ORG_A_ID" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Highway Construction",
    "description": "Project in Organization A",
    "status": "ACTIVE"
  }'

# Expected: 201 Created, organizationId = ORG_A_ID

# Bob creates project in Org B  
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/projects \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOB_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Organization-Id: $ORG_B_ID" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Mall Development",
    "description": "Project in Organization B",
    "status": "ACTIVE"
  }'

# Expected: 201 Created, organizationId = ORG_B_ID
```

#### Test 3.3: Verify Data Isolation
```bash
# Alice queries her organization's projects
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Organization-Id: $ORG_A_ID"

# Expected: 200 OK, returns ["Highway Construction"]

# Bob queries his organization's projects
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOB_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Organization-Id: $ORG_B_ID"

# Expected: 200 OK, returns ["Mall Development"]
```

#### Test 3.4: Cross-Organization Access (Should FAIL)
```bash
# Alice tries to access Org B
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Organization-Id: $ORG_B_ID"

# Expected: 403 Forbidden
# Message: "User is not a member of this organization"

# Bob tries to access Org A
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BOB_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Organization-Id: $ORG_A_ID"

# Expected: 403 Forbidden
# Message: "User is not a member of this organization"
```

#### Test 3.5: Missing Organization Context (Should FAIL)
```bash
# Request without X-Organization-Id header
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN"

# Expected: 403 Forbidden
# Message: "X-Organization-Id header is required"
```

#### Test 3.6: Add Member to Organization
```bash
# Create a third user (Charlie)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Charlie Member",
    "email": "charlie@test.com",
    "password": "password123"
  }'

# Get CHARLIE_USER_ID from response

# Alice adds Charlie to Org A as MEMBER
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/organizations/$ORG_A_ID/members \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Organization-Id: $ORG_A_ID" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "$CHARLIE_USER_ID",
    "role": "MEMBER"
  }'

# Expected: 200 OK, Charlie added

# Charlie logs in and queries Org A projects
CHARLIE_TOKEN="<from login>"

curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CHARLIE_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Organization-Id: $ORG_A_ID"

# Expected: 200 OK, sees ["Highway Construction"]
```

#### Test 3.7: Remove Member from Organization
```bash
# Alice removes Charlie from Org A
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/organizations/$ORG_A_ID/members/$CHARLIE_USER_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Organization-Id: $ORG_A_ID"

# Expected: 200 OK

# Charlie tries to access Org A again
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/projects \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CHARLIE_TOKEN" \
  -H "X-Organization-Id: $ORG_A_ID"

# Expected: 403 Forbidden (no longer a member)
```

## üîç Database Verification Queries

Once the backend is running, check H2 console at `http://localhost:8080/h2-console`:

```sql
-- Check users have String IDs
SELECT * FROM user;

-- Check organizations
SELECT * FROM organization;

-- Check organization members
SELECT * FROM organization_member;

-- Check projects with organization context
SELECT * FROM project;

-- Verify data isolation
SELECT p.* FROM project p
JOIN organization_member om ON p.organization_id = om.organization_id
WHERE om.user_id = '<ALICE_USER_ID>';

-- Should only return Org A projects
```

---

---

## üéì Key Implementation Details

The multi-tenancy implementation includes:

1. **OrganizationContextFilter** (backend/src/main/java/com/pms/filter/OrganizationContextFilter.java)
   - Intercepts all requests
   - Validates `X-Organization-Id` header
   - Checks user membership via `OrganizationMemberRepository`
   - Returns 403 for unauthorized access

2. **Updated Proxy Routes** (src/app/api/projects/route.ts)
   - Forwards `X-Organization-Id` header to backend
   - Maintains authorization token

3. **Database Schema**
   - `organization_member` table with roles (OWNER, ADMIN, MEMBER)
   - `user` table with String UUIDs (better-auth compatible)
   - `project` table with `organization_id` foreign key

4. **Security Configuration** (backend/src/main/java/com/pms/config/SecurityConfig.java)
   - Filter registered before JWT authentication
   - Protects all `/api/**` endpoints except auth

## ‚ö° Quick Start Command

To start testing immediately:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Spring Boot backend
cd backend && ./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Terminal 2: Verify backend is up
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

# Terminal 3: Run automated test script (create this)
./scripts/test-multi-tenancy.sh
```
